    "title": "Saving data before the app getting killed! Easy state restoration with Flutter",
    "description": "Imagine this scenario as a user: You are writing a long text in an app, keep switching between various apps, and return to the app, but notice the OS killed it! Now, all your written text is gone. What a terrible UX! How can we, as developers, help the user avoid running into this worst-case scenario? Simply keep and restore the appâ€™s state! We always discuss state management but forget about restoration. For my newest app, \"Japanana,\" I needed to include this feature. So, I will explain the implementation with an actual example. In this talk, I want to:\r\n\r\n- Show how to enable state restoration\r\n- Explain the differences between iOS and Android\r\n- Implement the restoration of our app state and discuss various strategies including navigation\r\n- Learn about multiple possibly unheard types such as RestorableInt and RestorableString\r\n- Adjust our tests with this new behaviour",
