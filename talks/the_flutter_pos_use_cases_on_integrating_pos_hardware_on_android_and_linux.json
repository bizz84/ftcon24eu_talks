    "title": "The Flutter POS: Use-cases on integrating POS Hardware on Android and Linux",
    "description": "This session explores the integration of Flutter applications with POS hardware across multiple platforms, focusing on Android and Linux. It will address the complete setup of a POS system, including printers, barcode scanners, card payment systems, and cash accepting solutions. Attendees will learn about bridging Flutter with native platform capabilities using Flutter's foreign function interface (FFI), method channels, and event channels, and how these can be leveraged to build a comprehensive POS system that works seamlessly on both Android and Linux.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this presentation is to demonstrate how Flutter can be effectively utilized to create robust, efficient, and secure POS systems on Android and Linux, paving the way for innovative retail and service solutions. This session will provide valuable skills and knowledge for developers looking to expand their expertise in multi-platform hardware integration using Flutter.",
