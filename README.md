## FlutterCon Europe 2024 Talks

🚨 **Quick update** 🚨

Someone else started a repo to gather all the FlutterCon talks and has made more progress than me.

We decided to work together. If you want to include your slides, please submit a PR to this repo:

- [https://github.com/martin-bertele/ftcon24eu](https://github.com/martin-bertele/ftcon24eu)

Eventually, both repos will be synced together.

I created this repo to collect all the video recordings and slides from the Flutter talks at [FlutterCon 24](https://fluttercon.dev/):

- [Agenda](https://fluttercon.dev/agenda/)
- [Speakers](https://fluttercon.dev/speakers/)
