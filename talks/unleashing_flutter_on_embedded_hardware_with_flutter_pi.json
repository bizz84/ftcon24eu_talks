Join us while we explore the current state of\r\nFlutter on embedded devices, and buckle up for a crash course that starts off with the basics and\r\nramps up to native OpenGL integration with platform channels.\r\n\r\nWhat you will take away:\r\n- Get a grounding in flutter-pi.\r\n- Learn about the basics of Flutter on embedded devices.\r\n- Be equipped with the basic knowledge needed to go and experiment with flutter on embedded\r\ndevices yourself.\r\n- How to communicate with external peripherals ( Using protocols such as I2C, GPIO, PWM and\r\nCANbus )\r\n- Be inspired to create bespoke user interfaces for embedded devices using Flutter.\r\n- Explore some more advanced techniques used in our star navigator demo.",
