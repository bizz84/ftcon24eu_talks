    "title": "Migrating 2+ Million Daily Users to Flutter with 50+ Engineers",
    "description": "talabat, one of MENA's leading food delivery apps serving 2+ million daily users across 8+ countries, started to migrate from native Android and iOS to Flutter.\r\n\r\nIn this session, weâ€™ll share insights from our journey, including our strategic add-to-app approach, the challenges we navigated, and how we empowered a team of 50+ mobile engineers during the transition.\r\n\r\nOur main goal is to help the audience learn from our mistakes like overusing dart entry points, misusages of Platform Channels, maintaining multiple Flutter Engines, challenges related to cross-platform deeplink navigation, and, most importantly, how crucial the culture that fosters education is.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we will discuss Flutter's scalability and adaptability in large applications and how to onboard Android/iOS engineers onto Flutter while highlighting how we set clear quality standards with guidelines to provide a structured pathway that ensures the quality of our migration process.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we will explore how to integrate Flutter into existing native Android and iOS codebases and emphasize the importance of experimentation throughout the transition, showcasing how we made data-driven decisions while ensuring our migration supports resilience and how Flutter enabled us to build SDUI solutions.\r\n\r\nFinally, attendees of this talk will learn about Flutter's enterprise viability, how its adoption strengthened our product development, the main metrics and benefits we received from the technology, and how Flutter allowed us to review our processes and practices to learn and grow, not just translate code from Swift, Kotlin, to Dart.",
