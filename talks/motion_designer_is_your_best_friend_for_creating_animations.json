  "title": "Motion Designer is your best friend for creating animations",
  "description": "Animation is a powerful tool to convey messages, evoke emotions, and send feedback on a user's action. Every detail of a good animation is well thought out and makes sense. A motion designer cares about it. Our task as developers is not to miss these details and implement exactly what our colleague has created. In this talk, I will share how we at Wolt approach this problem using motion specifications and Flutter.",
