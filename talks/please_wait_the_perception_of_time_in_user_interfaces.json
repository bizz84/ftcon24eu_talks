    "description": "Waiting is an essential part of everything: sometimes things just take a while. Apps are no different, the network and other factors are causing inevitable delays, resulting in a waiting user.

On the technical side, we learn how to creatively use Flutter widgets and futures to improve the user's experience, working with his expectation and (im)patience.",
