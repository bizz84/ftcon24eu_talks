    "description": "In this Rebel story, we'll explore the valuable lessons we've learned over our 17-year history of developing digital services and applications, with a special focus on our 6 years of experience with Flutter. During this time, we've created multiplatform and highly scalable end-to-end services for globally recognized brands like Netflix, Burger King, and Schaeffler.\r\n\r\nWe will dive deep into the KSML case study, illustrating how Rebel, using Flutter and the Flutter News Toolkit, digitally transformed the business of a major media company.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this story, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the strategic decisions big companies make when investing in Flutter applications, and why we at Rebel recommend Flutter in 9 out of 10 application cases.",
