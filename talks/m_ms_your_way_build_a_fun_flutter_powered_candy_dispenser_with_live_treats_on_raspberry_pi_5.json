This talk dives into building a custom M&M dispenser you control with code, powered by the mighty Raspberry Pi 5.\r\n\r\nWe'll ditch the screens and get our hands dirty (well, maybe not that dirty) as we:\r\n\r\n– Craft a sweet user interface to pick your perfect M&M color combo.\r\n– Unlock the secrets of connecting Flutter to real-world hardware (cue the M&M rain!).\r\n– Learn how to make your own interactive Flutter projects beyond the phone, leveraging the power of Raspberry Pi 5.\r\n\r\nGet ready for a sugar rush of knowledge (and maybe some real M&Ms)! This session features a live demo of the M&M dispenser on stage, so you can create your own custom mix.\r\n\r\nCalling all curious coders! This talk is perfect if you want to see Flutter in action on Raspberry Pi 5 and build something fun - with a delicious reward.",
