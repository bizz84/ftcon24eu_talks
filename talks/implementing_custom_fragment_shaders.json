    "title": "Implementing custom fragment shaders",
    "description": "Flutter uses fragment shaders to enable everyday UI features like gradients and blurs. Since Flutter started supporting custom shaders, they have been incorporated into some features used in our apps today.\r\n\r\nThis talk will showcase some of these fragment shaders and explain when and why we might use custom shaders instead of the standard building blocks provided by Flutter. Additionally, the talk will include a step-by-step guide on how to implement your first custom fragment shader.\r\n\r\nFinally, we'll showcase multiple demos that highlight the powerful effects you can achieve with custom shaders.",
