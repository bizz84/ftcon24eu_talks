    "title": "Creating responsive UIs and other nuances of Flutter Web",
    "description": "Flutter for Web is definitely less widespread than Flutter for mobile devices, but in my practice I have found it to be very powerful. Flutter Web has made reusing code between multiple platforms easier than ever and it enabled the use of a single frameworks across all the frontends of a project. This doesn't come without some nuances that developers should be aware of when building an app for the web.\r\n\r\nIn this session I will explore those nuances starting from tips on how to create a responsive UI, and then talking about web specific concepts such as SEO (or the lack of it) and dart:js. I will also touch on how to make text selectable, and on potential issues with it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main takeaways for the participants will be:\r\n- How to build a Responsive UI (LayoutBuilder, Wrap, Expanded, use fixed values, basic animations for UI transitions)\r\n- What is dart:js and what is dart:io -- how to conditionally import either of them\r\n- What is the state of SEO in Flutter and which are some solutions for the lack of support\r\n- Which are some issues with widgets on the web, most notably the default Text widget not being selectable",
