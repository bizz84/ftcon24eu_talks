    "title": "Presentation events - a missing piece in BLoC",
    "description": "The BLoC library/pattern is a very popular approach to state management in the Flutter ecosystem. While it is general enough to solve most business logic problems it fails to encode a specific type of state - presentation events!\r\n\r\nPresentation events are indications of side effects or one-off occurrences. It solves common use-cases such as showing a snackbar upon a successful form submit, or a navigator redirect after a failed server request.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you will learn how to enhance your BLoCs with presentation events, how create them, and why they solve an inherent problem present in BLoCs.",
