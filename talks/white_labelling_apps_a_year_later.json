    "description": "For the past year, Danielle has been working towards a completely configurable version of her company's Mortgage Application Flutter web app. In this talk, she will show examples taken from real code how this has been accomplished including\r\n\r\n1. The range of things being configured including images, typography, and even product content and program flow\r\n\r\n2. How JSON can be used to serialize everything including examples of difficult to achieve behavior like callback methods.\r\n\r\n3. The hard lessons learned during the journey to reach this milestone\r\n\r\n4. How testing can leverage this configuration approach",
